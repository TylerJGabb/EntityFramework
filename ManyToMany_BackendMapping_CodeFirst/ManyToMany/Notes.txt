At first I tried to create a model that would handle the many-to-many relationship under the hood without 
explicitly defining a Mapping object in the model. It turns out this doesn't work very well because
saving the changes in the context may or may not create new objects to fulfil the mapping.

I will try to implement a database-first model to see if this behavior can be fixed

My previous notes may not have been entirely correct.
Using the informastion I learned in the solution "M2M_ExplicitlyDefinedMapping_CodeFirst" notes,
the issue above may have been caused by nesting contexts. When explicitly grabbving existing requirements and tests from the database
and adding requirements to tests and vice versa, the mapping is updated correctly without additional requirements or tests created
due to the Id of those instances being <> 0

Yes, this appears to be working as I wanted it to.
